## Assignment Description
[Online Profiles Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/assignments/online-profiles/)

## Submission Instructions
 
### GitHub
https://github.com/lizardlaconic

I guess I should organize my github.  I have an old game project in C++ that I should probably upload too.
 
### LinkedIn
Do we HAVE to make a LinkedIn account?  I'm really paranoid about putting anything about myself online.

### Resume
https://github.com/lizardlaconic/liftoff-assignments/blob/master/C1-Online_Profiles/resume.pdf

Feel free to criticise my resume, I'll take all the advice I can get.

> *Your GitHub repository is public* if you do not want to upload your resume to a public facing repository talk with your Mentor about an alternate way to submit this assignment.
